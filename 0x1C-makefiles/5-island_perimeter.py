"""
This module calculate and returns the perimeter of island
has a grid that is a list of list of integers:

    0 represents a water zone
    1 represents a land zone
    One cell is a square with side length 1
    Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally).
    Grid is rectangular, width and height don't exceed 100

> Grid is completely surrounded by water, and there is one island (or nothing).
> (water inside that isn't connected to the water around the island).
